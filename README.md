# sign-change
A quick program to determine what letters to grab and what letters are already there between two messages

## Goals
This is just a small personal project to keep my coding skills fresh. I would like:
- [ ] Can take two inputs and deliver the resulting differences
- [ ] Create a clean tkinter UI so that other people can use it

That is really it. Hopefully this project can be completed in a week.
